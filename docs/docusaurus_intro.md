# Docusaurus Intro

Let's discover **Docusaurus**.

Docusaurus is an open-source tool for building documentation websites. It helps you quickly create and manage content with Markdown, offers a customizable layout, and supports versioning and search. It's designed for projects that need clear and structured documentation.

## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new page/document/blog**.

**I'm missing a link here. Because with the bold text, I don't know how to create a new page/document or blog**

Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**.
